          <h1>Who knows?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The only thing I know for certain is that I know nothing.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How much do you know?  Consider for a moment the vast amount of information that
you've accumulated in your lifetime:  the facts and trivia you learned through
school and work, your day to day experiences, the memory of your internal
thoughts and feelings over the years, what you've read, what you've seen with
your own two eyes...</p>
<p>It's easy to take for granted that we know something.  The human brain is
unparalleled in its ability to make short-term predictions extrapolated from
sensory input.  At its heart, this ability has to rely on the assumption that
said sensory input is valid.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the same mental processes that let us catch a ball thrown through
the air or have successful social interactions also cause us to favor our
existing mental model of the world over new information that makes us question
previous assumptions.  This can manifest in a number of ways, from logical
fallacies in otherwise well-intentioned discussions to social media echo
chambers that only reinforce already-held beliefs.</p>
<p>We build our entire worldview on our previous assumptions.  Obviously it would
be an impossible task to rethink everything we've ever known from first
principles every time we had to make a decision.  It's a much more efficient and
practical necessity to assume what we already know is pretty much true and tweak
it as new incoming information comes in.  This works great most of the time.
Questioning the fundamental nature of reality doesn't help you buy bananas at
the supermarket.</p>
<p>However, these adaptations that make it possible to cope with the day to day
world make it nearly impossible to accept information that would fundamentally
conflict with our preconceived worldview.  We will hold on to any shred of
anecdote to support what we already believe in the face of a mountain of
evidence to the contrary.  We will shut out those we once counted friends if
they share something sufficiently misaligned our beliefs.  We will choose where
we get our news and entertainment, where we shop, who we spend time with, even
where we live, based on creating an environment that doesn't challenge our
views.</p>
<p>Once we &quot;know&quot; something, it's exceedingly difficult to take a step back and
really think about <em>how</em> or <em>why</em> we know.  Taking this to its logical
conclusion results in the deepest rabbit hole of all rabbit holes, but I think
it's worth the effort.  It's turtles all the way down, but we'll dig as far as
we can.</p>
