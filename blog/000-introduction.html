          <p>
            It seems all blogs should have an introduction post, so here is
            ours!  Since this will probably be one of the first posts you read
            here, I'll take the opportunity to tell you a little bit about
            myself and explain my plans for the blog.
          </p>
          <p>
            First off...me!  My name is Daniel Sissom.  I am primarily an
            astrophysicist by training.  I went to Vanderbilt for grad school
            and graduated with my doctorate in physics in 2015.  I spent most
            of my time there throwing galaxies and black holes around in
            computers and watching how they evolved.  If you like the gritty
            details in that kind of thing, check out my
            <a href="http://etd.library.vanderbilt.edu/available/etd-03202015-141810/">dissertation</a>
            or my
            <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4815">paper</a>
            on the
            <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>.
            I've also dabbled in nuclear physics at the now-dismantled HRIBF at
            Oak Ridge National Lab during my undergraduate summers at Tennessee
            Tech.
          </p>
          <p>
            I say all that not to bore you with a r&eacute;sum&eacute;, but
            instead to give some indication of how I think about things.  I
            gravitate (warning: astro pun) toward thinking about the big
            picture.  I trust logic, even when it leads to counter-intuitive
            results.  I reserve the right to be wrong.  I love to argue if it
            means that someone is going to learn something (especially if that
            someone is me).  Much of how I approach a topic stems from training
            as a scientist, and what I find easiest to talk about results from
            what I've found interesting and tools I've found useful along the
            way.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am one of the (unfortunately, increasingly rare) examples of a
            scientist who is also a Christian.  I've always found the
            intersection of science and religion a very interesting topic
            &ndash; a topic, I'm sure, that will form a non-negligible
            percentage of the blog posts here.  I've been perpetually
            disappointed by how often Christians and the
            "scientifically-minded" are thought of as completely disparate
            groups, and, in fact, how much each group really does view the
            other as "the bad guys." Through some of the posts here, I hope to
            dispel as much of that nonsense as I can and show that we should
            all have more in common than you might think.
          </p>
          <p>
            I anticipate that most of this blog will be able to be boiled down
            to trying to be a good thinker:  approaching complex problems from
            first principles, using logic to make conclusions, referencing
            source material instead of cultural tradition, considering edge
            cases and ultimate ramifications, simplifying where possible, and
            asking why (a lot).  Once these things become second nature,
            discussing just about anything becomes much more fruitful.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other half of the site, the tutorials, will be a much more
            practical "how to do things" type of setup.  I expect this to be,
            for the most part, computer oriented, but won't shy away from other
            topics if something interesting comes up.  Topics will, naturally,
            tend to cover areas where I have some experience, so I should tell
            you some of the things I do.  I am a security-conscious Linux user
            and a command line junkie, and I have primarily been a Python, C,
            and Bash programmer in the realms of astrophysical simulations and
            data analysis.  I write papers with LaTeX and make (relatively
            simple) websites from scratch with HTML and CSS (using the Jade and
            SASS preprocessors).  I maintain Arch Linux systems and curate
            large amounts of data with redundant backup schemes.  I edit in
            Vim, version control everything with Git, and use Make and the
            age-old standard core utilities as an IDE.  I take pictures with a
            DSLR and an iPhone and process the results with a completely FOSS
            pipeline.  I experiment with OpenWRT and CJDNS and link wireless
            routers together into meshnets.  And I sing!  (Though that's not
            all that relavent to the tech tutorials...)  If these are the kind
            of things you are interested in or you'd like to learn, then the
            tutorials are for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you're here for the blog or the tutorials (or maybe even
            both), I hope this site will be useful to you.  I encourage you to
            give both sections a try and see if there is anything interesting
            there for you.  We are setting out on a journey together, and I bet
            we'll both learn something along the way.
