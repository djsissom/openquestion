          <h1>Play the odds</h1>
          <p>
            In statistical mechanics, a foundational concept is that the most
            likely macrostate is the one with the overwhelming majority of
            consistent microstates.  That is a lot to unpack in one sentence if
            you haven’t had a stat mech course, but the concept ends up being
            pretty intuitive (bear with some hand-wavy physics for just a
            moment).  A macrostate can be thought of as a measurable quantity of
            a system, like the air temperature in a room, while a microstate is
            a specific configuration of components of a system, like the
            specific positions and velocities of all the molecules of the air in
            a room.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            The particles making up the air could be in a tremendously large
            number of different configurations.  Random positions and velocities
            of each particle could result in microstate where every single
            particle was cramped over in a corner, leaving the rest of the room
            in a vacuum.  Or they could all end up with velocities pointing the
            same direction, creating a strong breeze out of nowhere.  However,
            we would never expect those outcomes, because compared to the
            vanishingly small number of configurations consistent with that
            "weird" macrostate, there are many, many orders of magnitude more
            configurations consistent with a "normal" macrostate where the
            particles are distributed evenly throughout the room with velocities
            consistent with measured physical laws.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            Imagine you were sitting in our air-filled room.  If I were to ask
            you about the exact position and speed of a specific particle, you
            wouldn’t be able to tell me.  In fact, even beyond the practical
            limitations of answering such a question, there exists a more
            fundamental limit on how well that question can be answered due to
            quantum mechanics (we’ll save that for another post . . . ).
            However, if I asked what the temperature of the room was, it would
            be stupidly easy to give me an answer, despite the unknowability of
            the movement of the individual particles that make up what a
            temperature is really a measure of.  A thermometer would give a
            fairly precise answer, but even just using the feeling of your skin,
            you could hazard a pretty good guess.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            Your temperature measurement, in addition to masking the complexity
            of the physical world with a statistical measurement, also makes an
            assumption about about the whole room using a measurement from just
            one location.  Here, I’m not talking about convection currents and
            temperature gradients from elevation (which are totally a thing that
            can make your measurement less valid), but instead the assumption
            that you are making a measurement at a non-special time and place.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            It could be entirely possible, going back to the previous microstate
            concept, that your temperature measurement just happened to occur
            right before all the particles in the room ended up in the corner by
            pure chance, or that a little sphere around your thermometer had a
            normal distribution of velocities to give you your reading, but all
            the rest of the air was suddenly much colder because all the
            molecules bumped into each other in just the right way to slow them
            down.  While these circumstances are "possible,” no one would expect
            them to be the case, because the chance of that one special state
            occurring would be completely dwarfed by the vast number of particle
            configurations that lead to your measurement being representative of
            the evenly distributed properties.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            All of this has been a long-winded and probably overly complex
            illustration to make a simple analogy (you’ll probably have to get
            used to that kind of thing here).  You can’t know everything.  I
            would, as briefly introduced in the previous post, even extend this
            as far as saying you can’t really know anything.  But, this
            fundamental limitation on absolute knowledge doesn’t mean that you
            can’t have a pretty good guess.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            We can’t know every underlying complexity of the world around us.
            We can’t prove that something happened.  We can’t really prove
            anything.  But we can gather evidence.  We can see trends.  We can
            extrapolate.  We can predict.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no mathematical proof that my senses give me accurate
            information, that I’m not just a Boltzmann brain randomly assembled
            by chance from interstellar dust with my current memories
            pre-formed.  I can, however, assign estimated probabilities to
            possible realities and behave accordingly.  If I, say, decide (as an
            arbitrary example) that there’s a 99.999% probability that reality
            is as it seems (and we are all biological life forms inhabiting the
            surface of a rocky terrestrial planet), and there’s a 0.001% chance
            that I am a Boltzmann brain, existing only for the briefest instant
            as the only consciousness in the Universe, it’s probably pretty safe
            to behave as though the former is the truth, despite the inability
            to unquestionably prove the validity of that option.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            I have come to a point where I can no longer accept anything as
            absolutely certain.  This is not to say that truth does not exist.
            Systems exist in a certain state regardless of our knowledge of them
            or even our ability to have knowledge of them.  However, any claim
            to know something as a certainty seems utter nonsense.  There are
            too many abstraction layers between our conception and the reality
            of the physical world, each with an underlying set of assumptions
            that allow us to process and make decisions.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            So what then?  Are we doomed to ignorance and instinct?  If nothing
            can be known about the world, how do we do anything?  How do we
            build skyscrapers or put people in space or tie our shoes?
            
          </p>
          <p>
            In a word:  models.  Predictive models underly our every conception
            about the physical world, whether or not we are explicitly aware of
            them.  We will discuss models more in depth in a future post, but
            the concept of models informing our decisions is fairly
            straightforward.
            
          </p>
          <p>What <em>is</em> gravity?  That’s a pretty complex question.  Good luck
            finding someone to answer it.  But you don’t have to understand
            general relativity to catch a ball.  You make observations of flying
            balls over the course of your life, incorporate that input into your
            mental model of how balls fall through the air, and use that model
            to make a prediction of where the ball will land.  Are you making
            calculations for orbits of GPS satellites or black hole dynamics?
            Then yes, you will need some GR for that.  But again, even general
            relativity is just a predictive model that, while matching
            predictions to observed outcomes extremely precisely, only gives us
            an abstraction of the underlying reality, not the underlying reality
            itself.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            Fundamentally, general relativity and a toddler’s prediction of how
            a ball will bounce are the same kind of thing.  However, the
            difference comes in when we consider the predictive power of the
            models, and thus the relative probability that each model is a good
            description of reality.  Evidence of predictive power is really the
            only thing we have, and can have, to go on.
            
          </p>
          <p>So, can you <em>know</em> something?  I would say, fundamentally, no.
            But, the predictive power of experimentally verified models lets us
            have a pretty good idea.  Between options, even in the face of
            fundamental ignorance, we can make the choice with the higher
            <em>probability</em> of being right.  Most of the time, the odds are
            overwhelming.
